-- Danger! Changes to this schema definition need to be made carefully to

-- 1) Never add columns to an existing CREATE statement: write a separate ALTER
--    TABLE statement instead.
-- 2) Don't modify the primary keys of a table after it is created.
-- 3) Create static data using UPDATE statements
